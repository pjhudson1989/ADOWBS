# Air Deployable Ocean Wave Buoy System (ADOWBS)

This project centers on installation of wave gauges on small ocean buoys that can easily deployed from an aircraft, self-anchor, and transmit processed wave data back to shore using the Starlink Network. 

## Background
Larger wave buoys are regularly deployed for long periods throughout the oceans.  See, for example, the [National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) which shows all NDBD buoys worldwide.  They are expensive, require maintenance and planning, and are built to be rugged to survive years of high wind and waves. However, ocean engineering projects often require wave data for defined geographic area that may not be covered by one of these larger buoys.  While engineers can deploy a traditional buoy system, this requires use of a vessel that can cost as much as $100K per day.  The US Navy has used air-deployed sonar buoys (sonobuoys) to quickly measure acoustic data in the area of a suspected submarine. These are expendable buoys that transmit until their batteries die and then generally sink.  This concept has also been applied to acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCPs) that use acoustic dopler technology to measure currents from the surface down to the seabed.

## Purpose
Develop a small buoy system with the following characteristics:
 - Air-deployable from either helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft
 - Self-anchoring in waters up to 50 m deep
 - Initial data processing onboard the buoy
 - Automatically connect and transmit processed data via Starlink
 - Total cost of each buoy should be less than $10K

# Development Plan
To minimize cost, the components of the buoy system should be commerical off-the-shelf.  Integration of components and the communication system, as well as software for controlling and processing the buoy data, are expected to be the critical path. A cyclic integration process with multiple at-sea tests will be used to refine and test the components and overall system.
